# Contributing to at://2048

Want to implement a feature or help solving that nasty bug? You are at the
right page - this document will guide you through setting up everything you may
need to get this project up and running.

## So, how do I run it locally?

- Clone this project using your preferred tools:

```bash
# Regular git clone
git clone https://github.com/fatfingers23/at_2048.git

# Clone using SSH (the most secure way)
git clone git@github.com:fatfingers23/at_2048.git

# Clone using GitHub CLI (the most convenient way)
gh repo clone fatfingers23/at_2048

```

Now, you have two choices:

- [Setup](#setup)
- [Set up with Nix](#setup-with-nix-optional)

### Setup

- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), if you haven't already
- Add Wasm target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- [Install npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Install project dependencies using `npm` and `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install trunk wasm-bindgen-cli
```

- Go to the `app_2048` directory: `cd at_2048/app_2048`
- Run `npm install`

### Setup with Nix (Optional)

- Install [Determinate Nix](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) (skip if you are on NixOS
  with [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) enabled)
- `cd at_2048`
- `direnv allow`
- Make a cup of tea while dependencies are being downloaded
- Once it's done, (dependencies loading, not tea) `cd app_2048`
- `npm install`

After that, it might be a good idea to run `nix flake update` and see if
`flake.lock` file at the project root directory is changed. This way, you'll
ensure you have the latest packages installed.

### Running the project

Open the `app_2048` directory and run `trunk serve`. You should see something
like this:

Visit http://localhost:8080, traverse the project files, and go on, do some
hacking!

## I've done something cool and would like to share. How can I?

Go to this repository's
page, [fork it](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=webui&platform=linux#forking-a-repository),
save your changes using `git commit`, then push it:

```bash
git remote add github git@github.com:<YOUR_USERNAME>/at_2048.git # only needed once
git push github <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
```

After that, come back to this repository and GitHub will propose you to open
the pull request. Do it!

## How do I update the project files? I want to have the latest codebase!

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```

Boom! Your codebase is now straight from the oven again.

## I have unanswered questions. Where can I ask them?

Feel free to DM or @ me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/2048.blue), or
open a new issue if you encountered a problem.
